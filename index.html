    <pre><font size="+2"><b style="color: wheat;">- Get on the court, and stay close to volleyball</b><br></font>
	- Come back from the summer with minimum rust.<br>
	- Keep watching film and learn from high level volleyball<br>
  <pre><font size="+2"><b style="color: wheat;">- Lift and stretch. Gain strength and mobility</b><br></font>
	- Goal is to always be physically available next year.<br>
	- Baseline is high, but being an athlete this is important.<br>
  <pre><font size="+2"><b style="color: wheat;">- Eat a sustainable, nutrient dense diet</b><br></font>
	- Find a diet that I can maintain through next year.<br>
        - Keep track of macros/calories over the course of a week.<br>
  <pre><font size="+2"><b style="color: wheat;">- Meditation/Focus</b><br></font>
	- Perhaps more important than physical availability is mental availability.<br>
	- Objective is to use meditation/focus to guide me toward more stability <br><pre>          in mindset, and thus my mood and motivation<br>
	- Build habits that can be maintained throughout a year/season.<br>
  <pre><font size="+2"><b style="color: wheat;">- Read books. Knowledge is power.</b><br></font>
	- Read books that expand my perspective, and help build/adjust my mindset.<br>
  <pre><font size="+2"><b style="color: wheat;">- Become less affected by externalities.</b><br></font>
	- A question to answer this summer is how I can be less affected by my environment,<br><pre>          shape my environment in a way that is conducive to my wellbeing, or both.<br>
