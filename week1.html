     <p class="paragraph">Meditations is dense. Read through Book One twice. Going to pivot and keep reading for a few more weeks.
      As my goal is to set habits this summer, I'm going to read this book slowly and put what I take away into practice.<br><br>
      Quotes that stuck with me:<br>
      - To want little, and to work with my own hands.<br>
      - Not to walk about in the house in my outdoor clothes.<br>
      - To always be the same, even in sharp pains, on the occasion of loss.<br>
      - Join in an inquiry about what was said, not about the word.<br>
      - To do what was set before me without complaining.<br>
      - To be satisfied on all occasions, and cheerful.<br>
      - To provide for others without display.
      </p>

      An hour of film 4 days a week felt like a lot. So, I switched it to 30 minutes a day. Watched back BWT,
      and watched Iran vs Japan in Tokyo. Thought it'd be interesting to watch the liberos in each match. Can't go wrong
      watching arguably 3 of the top 5 liberos in the NCAA, and high level players on the international stage.<br><br>
      Some notes:<br>
      - Every libero has a consistent routine before serve receive.<br>
      - On defense, very little movement digging down the line but movement/hops digging in cross court.<br>
      - Makes sense considering there's more court to cover in the cross court, hadn't thought of this before.

      Been getting my ‘active’ meditation in right before bed, and I'm rethinking the timing of it. Haven't gotten past 15 minutes yet.
      Notice that I get distracted by tiredness. Going to try to do it first thing in the morning next week.<br><br>
      Lifting and stretching as expected. Noticing progress already which is nice.<br><br>
      Very excited for the next couple months.
